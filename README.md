# DeepSnake

A Deep Learning Enhanced Snake Game.

This repository contains the code for a Snake game developed using Pygame. The game is enhanced with a Deep Learning model for decision-making, implemented using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

The project involves the development of a classic Snake game with a twist. The game's complexity and interaction have been enhanced by implementing a Deep Learning model for decision-making. The model was trained based on the game's state and reward information.

## Technologies Used

- **Pygame:** Used for game development, providing the game's basic structure.
- **PyTorch:** Used for implementing the Deep Learning model that guides the snake's decision-making process.
